# FitForU

A tool for students to ‘fine-tune’ their own conversational agents (chatbots woo) with information from a textbook, slideshow, or lecture video. ChatGPT is great for general/creative purposes, but doesn’t know details/intricacies of coursework, and is bad at giving specific answers/explanations. 

With FitForU, you can upload the pdf of your textbook, link to lecture videos, notes, and slideshow presentations to train your chatbot. In return, it'll be able to answer specific questions about a certain lecture, theorem, or type of problem set. It's built on top of a language model (I'm experimenting with davincii, roberta, and maybe some others) to have a basis for sentence structure, but then improving the model from there. 

The hardest part so far is building a generalizeable away to convert messy text to clean training data. But, woo, data science!
